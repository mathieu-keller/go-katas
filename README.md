# Go Coding Katas

This repository contains a collection of coding katas that I have implemented to improve my understanding of the Go programming language.

## What are Coding Katas?

Coding Katas are small coding exercises that are meant to practice programming skills. They are a great way to learn a new programming language or to improve your existing skills.

## How to Use This Repository

Each directory in this repository represents a different coding kata. Inside each directory, you will find a README file that explains the problem that the kata is meant to solve, and a .go file that contains the solution.

## Implemented Katas

Here, you can list all the katas you have implemented. For example:

1. [Bowling](./Bowling/README.MD)

## Running the Katas

To run a kata, navigate to its directory and run the .go file. For example:

```bash
cd Bowling
go run main.go
```
